# Inter-act

Inter-act is a team project developed during QUT Colab. QUT Colab was an event to design innovative solutions to learning and teaching problems through design thinking, ideating, prototyping, testing and pitching. 

Our team's idea was placed in the top three projects and progressed to a higher level of development. Interact is a platform to create a supportive environment for international students at QUT. 

This platform will share meaningful experiences and insights from the experienced students to encourage active learning in QUT. This project is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
