                <img src="img2/3.presentation.jpg" class="article-img">
                <p>One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned over the last few years is that to be a great presenter, it’s key to 
                    develop a personal speaking style. Since I know I’m not the most eloquent speaker in the world, I make up for 
                    it by packing my presentations with enthusiasm, unique/proprietary data, and tons of useful content. Following 
                    are my <b>20 best tips to improve your presentation skills</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Practice:</b> Rehearsing your presentation multiple times is essential if you want to deliver a rousing 
                        presentation. If you really want to sound great, write out your speech rather than taking chances winging it 
                        – if you get nervous about speaking, a script is your best friend. Try to practice where you'll be delivering 
                        your talk. Some acting strategists suggest rehearsing lines in various positions – standing up, sitting down, 
                        with arms open wide. The more you mix up your position and setting, the more comfortable you'll feel with your 
                        speech. Do a practice run for a friend or colleague, or try recording your presentation and playing it back to 
                        evaluate which areas need work. Listening to recordings of your past talks can clue you in to bad habits you may 
                        be unaware of, as well as inspiring the age-old question: "Is that what I really sound like?"
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Transform nervous energy into enthusiasm:</b> It may sound strange, but I'll often down my favourite beverage 
                        and snack and listen to some peppy music in my earphones before presenting. Why? It pumps me up and helps me 
                        turn jitters into focused enthusiasm. Studies have shown that an enthusiastic speech can win out over an 
                        eloquent one, and so I make sure that I'm as enthusiastic and energetic as possible before going on stage.      
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Attend other presentations:</b> If you're giving a presentation as part of an assessment, try to attend 
                        some of the earlier presentations by other students to scope out their presentation skills and get some context. 
                        This shows respect for your fellow presenters while also giving you a chance to feel out the audience. 
                        Are the presentations more strategic or tactical in nature? Another speaker may also say something that you 
                        can play off of later in your own presentation.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Arrive early:</b> It's always best to allow yourself plenty of time to settle in before your talk. 
                        Extra time ensures you won't be late (even if Google Maps shuts down) and gives you plenty of time to get 
                        adapted to your presentation space.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Adjust to your surroundings:</b> The more adjusted to your environment you are, the more comfortable you'll 
                        feel. Make sure to spend some in the room where you will be delivering your presentation. If possible, 
                        practice with the microphone and lighting, make sure you understand the seating and be aware of any distractions 
                        potentially posed by the venue (e.g., a noisy road outside).
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Meet and greet:</b> Do your best to chat with people before your presentation. Talking with audiences makes 
                        you seem more likeable and approachable. Ask event attendees questions and take in their responses. They may 
                        even give you some inspiration to weave into your talk.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Use positive visualization:</b> Whether or not you’re a Zen master, know that plenty of studies have proven 
                        the effectiveness of positive visualization. When we imagine a positive outcome to a scenario in our mind, it's 
                        more likely to play out the way we envision. Instead of thinking "I'm going to be terrible out there" and 
                        visualizing yourself throwing up mid-presentation, imagine yourself getting tons of laughs while presenting 
                        with the enthusiasm of Jimmy Fallon and the poise of Audrey Hepburn (the charm of George Clooney wouldn't hurt 
                        either). Positive thoughts can be incredibly effective – give them a shot.                        
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Remember that most audiences are empathetic:</b>  One of the hardest fears to shake when presenting is that 
                        the audience is secretly waiting to laugh at your missteps or mistakes. Fortunately, this isn’t the case in the 
                        vast majority of presentations.
                        <p>The audience wants to see you succeed. In fact, many people have a fear of public speaking, so even if the 
                            audience seems indifferent, the chances are pretty good that most people listening to your presentation can 
                            relate to how nerve-racking it can be. If you start to feel nervous, remind yourself that the audience gets 
                            it, and actually wants to see you nail it.
                        </p>

                    </li>
                    <li><b>Take deep breaths:</b> The go-to advice for jitters has truth to it. When we're nervous, our muscles 
                        tighten--you may even catch yourself holding your breath. Instead, go ahead and take those deep breaths to 
                        get oxygen to your brain and relax your body.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Smile:</b> Smiling increases endorphins, replacing anxiety with calm and making you feel good about 
                        your presentation. Smiling also exhibits confidence and enthusiasm to the crowd. And this tip works even 
                        if you're doing a webinar and people can't see you. Just don't overdo it – no one enjoys the maniacal clown look.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Exercise:</b> Exercise earlier in the day prior to your presentation to boost endorphins, which 
                        will help alleviate anxiety.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Work on your pauses:</b> When you're nervous, it's easy to speed up your presentation and end up talking 
                        too fast, which in turn causes you to run out of breath, get more nervous, and panic! Don't be afraid to 
                        slow down and use pauses in your speech. Pausing can be used to emphasize certain points and to help your 
                        talk feel more conversational. If you feel yourself losing control of your pacing, just take a nice pause 
                        and keep cool.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Don’t try to cover too much material:</b> Yes, your presentations should be full of useful, insightful, 
                        and actionable information, but that doesn’t mean you should try to condense a vast and complex topic into 
                        a 5-minute presentation. Knowing what to include, and what to leave out, is crucial to the success of a good presentation. I’m 
                        not suggesting you skimp when it comes to data or including useful slides, but I am advocating for a 
                        rigorous editing process. If it feels too off-topic, or is only marginally relevant to your main points, 
                        leave it out.

                    </li>
                    <li><b>Actively engage the audience:</b> People love to talk and make their opinions heard, but the nature 
                        of presentations can often seem like a one-sided proposition. It doesn’t have to be, though. Asking the 
                        audience what they think, inviting questions, and other means of welcoming audience participation can boost 
                        engagement and make attendees feel like a part of a conversation. It also makes you, the presenter, seem much 
                        more relatable.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Be entertaining:</b> Even if your presentation is packed with useful information, if your delivery bombs, 
                        so will your session. I find that including some light-hearted slides is a great way to help the audience 
                        (and myself) feel more comfortable, especially when presenting them with a great deal of information. 
                        However, it’s important to maintain a balance – after all, you’re not performing a stand-up routine, and 
                        people didn’t come to your presentation with the sole intention of being entertained. That said, don’t be 
                        afraid to inject a little humor into your talk. If you’re not sure about whether a presentation is “too much,” 
                        run through it for a couple of friends and ask them to tell it to you straight.

                    </li>
                    <li><b>Admit you don’t have all the answers:</b> Very few presenters are willing to publicly concede that they 
                        don’t actually know everything because they feel it undermines their authority. However, since we all know 
                        that nobody can ever know everything about a given topic, admitting so in a presentation can actually improve 
                        your credibility.
                        If someone asks a question that stumps you, it’s okay to admit it. This can also increase your credibility 
                        with the audience, as it demonstrates that, no matter how knowledgeable a person might be, we’re all learning, 
                        all the time.
                        
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Use a power stance:</b> Practicing confident body language is another way to boost your pre-presentation 
                        jitters. When your body is physically demonstrating confidence, your mind will follow suit. Studies have shown 
                        that using power stances a few minutes before giving a talk (or heading to a big interview) creates a lasting 
                        sense of confidence and assurance. Whatever you do, don't sit--sitting is passive. Standing or walking a bit 
                        will help you harness those stomach bats (isn't that more appropriate than butterflies?). Before you go on 
                        stage, strike your best Power Ranger stance and hold your head high!
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Drink Water:</b> Dry mouth is a common result of anxiety. Prevent cottonmouth blues by staying hydrated 
                        and drinking plenty of water before your talk (just don't forget to hit the bathroom before starting). Keep 
                        a bottle of water at arm's reach while presenting in case you get dry mouth while chatting up a storm.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Join Toastmasters:</b> Toastmaster clubs are groups across the country (and the world) dedicated to 
                        helping members improve their presentation skills. Groups get together during lunch or after work to take 
                        turns delivering short talks on a chosen topic. The more you present, the better you'll be, so consider 
                        joining a Toastmaster club to become a top-notch orator.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Don't fight the fear:</b> Accept your fear rather than trying to fight it. Getting yourself worked up 
                        by wondering if people will notice your nervousness will only intensify your anxiety. Remember, those jitters 
                        aren't all bad – harness that nervous energy and transform it into positive enthusiasm and you'll be golden.
                    </li>
