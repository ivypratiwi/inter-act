                <p>Effective group work does not happen by accident. It involves deliberate effort, and because there are many people 
                    involved it must not be left up to memory; good note taking is essential. Following these steps will help you and 
                    your group to work effectively together.
                </p>
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Have clear objectives:</b> At each stage you should try to agree on goals. These include a timetable for
                         progress on the project as well as more immediate goals (e.g. to agree on an approach to the assignment by 
                         Friday). Each meeting or discussion should also begin with a goal in mind (e.g. to come up with a list of tasks 
                         that need to be done).

                    </li>
                    <li><b>Set ground rules:</b> Discussions can become disorderly and can discourage shyer group members from 
                        participating if you don't have procedures in place for encouraging discussion, coming to resolution without 
                        becoming repetitive, and resolving differences of opinion. Set rules at the outset and modify them as necessary 
                        along the way. An interesting rule that one group made was that anybody who missed a meeting would buy the rest
                         of the group a cup of coffee from the coffee shop. Nobody ever missed a meeting after that.       
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Communicate efficiently:</b> Make sure you communicate regularly with group members. Try to be clear and 
                        positive in what you say without going on or being repetitive.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Build consensus:</b> People work together most effectively when they are working toward a goal that they 
                        have agreed to. Ensure that everyone has a say, even if you have to take time to get more withdrawn members 
                        to say something. Make sure you listen to everyone's ideas and then try to come to an agreement that everyone 
                        shares and has contributed to.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Define roles:</b> Split the work to be done into different tasks that make use of individual strengths. 
                        Having roles both in the execution of your tasks and in meetings / discussions (e.g. Arani is responsible for 
                        summarising discussions, Joseph for ensuring everybody has a say and accepts resolutions etc.) can help to make a happy, 
                        effective team.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Clarify:</b> When a decision is made, this must be clarified in such a way that everyone is absolutely clear 
                        on what has been agreed, including deadlines.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Keep good records:</b> Communicating on the online discussion for your group provides a good record of 
                        discussion. Try to summarise face-to-face discussions and especially decisions, and post them to the online 
                        discussion so that you can refer back to them. This includes lists of who has agreed to do what.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Stick to the plan:</b> If you agreed to do something as part of the plan, then do it. Your group members 
                        are relying on you to do what you said you would do not what you felt like doing. If you think the plan should 
                        be revised, then discuss this.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Monitor progress and stick to deadlines:</b> As a group, discuss progress in relation to your timetable 
                        and deadlines. Make sure that you personally meet deadlines to avoid letting your group down.
                    </li>
