                <p>Students are infinitely curious – they want to understand the world around them, how it all works, where it comes from, and how to interact with it. And yet, 
                    research shows that students ask few questions during classes/tutorials. Well, why is effectively asking questions pivotal for learning and successful study outcome?
                        
                </p>
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Questions reveal interest:</b> We ask questions when something said catches our attention, surprises us, or when we hear 
                        something we want more information about. Asking almost any question is a clear signal that says “Hey! I am paying attention 
                        and I want to know more!”Asking a great question? That’s even more revealing.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Questions reveal gaps in, and strength of understanding:</b> As students, we know that not everything we that is said in 
                        the classroom will be understood the first time. Therefore, it make learning and understanding a whole lot 
                        easier when we asked a question that can clarify a misunderstanding or explain something in a better way.
                        This also gives a chance to fill in the gaps and likely improve understanding for other students too.                        
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Questions improve recall:</b> Research shows that when you ask a question yourself, you are more likely to remember the 
                        information you receive. It makes sense – you are likely asking about something that is interesting or relevant to you, and 
                        by asking the question you become personally invested in the answer.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Questions keeps us engaged:</b> A question can take a tutorial in which the tutor is doing the talking to a discussion 
                        that is more engaging for the students as they are now personally involved in the knowledge sharing process.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Questions build a foundation for new knowledge:</b> Any subject or topic starts out with broad, foundational information 
                        that forms the basis for more in depth or specific knowledge. A basic understanding of how plants grow is essential to the 
                        discussion of how dessert plants differ from those growing in rain forests.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p>A question posed at the right time builds that essential knowledge – with that understanding, the more complex, more interesting 
                    knowledge has roots, and the learning keeps on building.
