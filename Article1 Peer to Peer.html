                <p>Much of what we do every day depends on having a positive working relationship with our peers. Being able to communicate effectively with our peers in a university 
                    environment helps us achieve our study goals promptly and effectively by asking and answering questions, sharing information, and offering feedback. Not to mention that effective communication can bring fun and positive energy to the classroom.
                    To make the most of your peer-to-peer (P2P) communications, there are 10 rules you should follow:
                </p>
                <p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Understand your communication style:</b> The first rule of communication is to become self-aware and realize how you like to communicate. 
                        This means identifying whether you are a direct and to-the-point communicator, a storyteller, a more systematic and logical communicator or someone who dwells on relationship building to communicate with others effectively.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Reflect on how others react to your communications:</b> By thinking about the effectiveness of the last 
                        few communications you had with a peer helps you identify the common elements or trends, so as to rely on them for effective peer-to-peer communication.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Share the best way for others to communicate with you:</b> With a little introspect, you could identify what means and styles of communication work for you. By making your peers 
                        aware of this understanding in a fair and respectful manner, you could create an effective communication channel with peers.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Communicate on the other person's channel:</b> Once you know how another person wants to receive communication, it's your responsibility to communicate that way.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Learn how stress impacts communications:</b> When people are under stress, they react differently. I've seen student peers totally botch up conversations because they so desperately needed to get their message 
                        out, they couldn't wait for the recipient to be ready to receive it. That's what stress will do.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Deliver messages at the right moments:</b> its imperative to know what is an ideal moment 
                        to communicate with effectiveness. It’s sensible to avoid having that important topic discussion when your peer is trying to get something done and is right in the middle of it.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Use the proper tools:</b> It's time for all of us to realize there are some messages 
                        you can send on Slack or MS Teams, others that should be sent via email, and then those that need a voice-to-voice conversation. Using the right medium to send a message can make all the difference in the world when it comes to how your message will be received.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Recognize others in a way that makes them feel good:</b> Recognizing others isn't just a task for tutors or lecturers. 
                        You should recognize your peers for a task or activity well done and when they help you do your task or understand a topic better.
                        For recognition to be effective, it has to be given in a way that makes the other person feel important.   
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Be empathetic: </b> This applies to many of the rules above. If you take a moment to put yourself in your peer’s shoes, 
                        it can positively impact your communications with them. Whether they're happy or stressed, you can either share in their enthusiasm or not contribute to their frustration.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>And if, after all of this, the communication gets messed up, don't let it fester. Fix it:  </b> Yes, there will be times when, no matter how hard you try, the communication will not go as planned. Instead of ignoring the situation and potentially having it get worse, have a conversation with your peers. Let them know that having a positive working relationship is important, and you'd like to talk it out.
                        The working relationships we have with our peers can make us or break us. Developing good communications with them benefits everyone and makes coming to classes a whole lot easier.
